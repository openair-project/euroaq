    The `import_eea_monitoring()` function is the most convenient method for
    accessing European air quality data offered by {euroaq}. It deals with
    importing and cleaning air quality data, and binding on useful metadata
    columns such as the site name, station type, and location. Nevertheless, it
    is also very opinionated, so users may wish to use
    `download_eea_parquet_files()` or similar for greater control.

    These functions don't import air quality data, but provide useful metadata
    to assist with the use of `import_eea_monitoring()`.

    These functions provide direct access to the EEA's Air Quality Download
    Service, found at <https://eeadmz1-downloads-webapp.azurewebsites.net/>.
    These functions are purposefully conservative with how they handle their
    returned values data outputs; they are therefore closest to using the API
    directly, but expect the most from the user.
